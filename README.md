# Computer Organization I - MIPS Project #

This MIPS Program converts up to 32-bit hexadecimal numbers to their corresponding decimal 
interger.

## Features: ##
  + Reads a string of up to 8 characters from user input.
  + If the input string is made up of only characters form the sets {'0' to '9'}, {'a' to 'f'} and {'A' to 'F'}, the program prints out the corresponding unsigned decimal integer.
  + Otherwise, the program prints out the error message, "Invalid hexadecimal number.".
  + Note: The program ignores leading and lagging spaces in the input and will produce the error message in such cases.

## Requirements: ##
  + A MIPS simulator is required to run this program. 
  + The two recommended simulators are QtSpim and MARS. 
  + You will also be required to have Java SE installed on your system if you decide 
	to go with MARS.
